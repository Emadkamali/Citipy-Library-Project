# WeatherPy
In the WeatherPy project, I employed the Citipy library to randomly generate a list of over 500 cities worldwide. Subsequently, I iterated through this list to gather pertinent weather data using the OpenWeather API, employing JSON traversals to extract the necessary information.

Utilizing my expertise in data manipulation with Pandas, I constructed dataframes to organize and analyze the collected weather data. Through visualization techniques in Matplotlib, I graphically depicted weather patterns, particularly focusing on trends associated with a city's latitude.

To enhance the analytical insights, I developed a function capable of automatically generating regression plots, determining correlation coefficients, and annotating these plots with the line of best-fit equation. This approach facilitated a deeper understanding of how various weather parameters correlate with a city's latitude, thereby empowering informed decision-making and insightful interpretations.

# VacationPy

In VacationPy, I utilized the Google Maps API (gmaps) within a Jupyter Notebook to generate a comprehensive map featuring all cities in the dataset. By assigning humidity levels as the weighting factor for the heatmap layer, I visually depicted the global distribution of humidity across different regions.

Using the wealth of data previously gathered from cities, I established specific criteria to identify optimal vacation destinations. Leveraging the power of the Google Places API, I conducted targeted searches to locate hotels situated within a 5,000-meter radius of these ideal vacation spots.

Subsequently, I integrated the results of these searches onto the existing map, effectively overlaying pins representing the locations of hotels. This final map provided a holistic view, combining humidity data with convenient access to nearby accommodations. As a data analyst, this approach facilitated the identification of suitable vacation destinations while considering important factors such as weather conditions and lodging options.
